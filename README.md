# Owen Lab

Personal website and development hub for my projects, experiments, and tools.  
Hosted with **GitHub Pages** and served at:

👉 https://owenlab.dev

This site is my dedicated space for building, testing, and showcasing what I’m working on.

## 🧪 About Owen Lab

Owen Lab is my personal dev workshop where I share:

- Software projects and utilities  
- UI / UX experiments  
- Desktop and web tools  
- Local AI and automation projects  
- Ongoing technical experiments

The goal is to keep everything lightweight, fast, and easy to explore in a browser.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This site is built using simple, reliable web tech:

- **HTML** – structure
- **CSS** – styling
- **JavaScript** – interactivity (when needed)
- **GitHub Pages** – hosting
- **Cloudflare** – DNS & domain management

No backend required — everything runs client-side.

## 📁 Project Structure
```
├── .gitignore  
├── CNAME  
├── index.html  
├── script.js  
├── style.css  
│  
└── assets/  
    ├── icons/  
    └── images/

This repo only contains what’s needed to run the live website.  
IDE files (like `.idea/`) are intentionally excluded.
```
## 🚀 Deployment

The site is deployed automatically using **GitHub Pages**:

1. Code is pushed to the `main` branch
2. GitHub builds and deploys the site
3. The custom domain `owenlab.dev` points to the live version via Cloudflare

No manual server management is required.

## 🎯 Purpose

Owen Lab exists as:

- A public portfolio  
- A place to document experiments  
- A launch page for future tools  
- A personal learning log

Content will grow and evolve over time as new projects are added.
