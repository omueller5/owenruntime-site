## 🧪 About Owen Lab

Owen Lab is my personal dev workshop where I share:

- Software projects and utilities  
- UI / UX experiments  
- Desktop and web tools  
- Local AI and automation projects  
- Ongoing technical experiments  
- **Minecraft: Java Edition mods**

The goal is to keep everything lightweight, fast, and easy to explore in a browser.

## ⛏️ Minecraft Modding

I also develop mods for **Minecraft: Java Edition**, primarily using the  
**Fabric** mod loader and targeting modern Minecraft versions.

These mods focus on:
- New blocks, items, tools, and armor  
- Custom crafting systems and gameplay mechanics  
- Themed content and experimental features  

Mods are showcased directly on the site with screenshots, feature summaries,
and links to source code or release pages when available.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This site is built using simple, reliable web tech:

- **HTML** – structure  
- **CSS** – styling  
- **JavaScript** – interactivity (when needed)  
- **GitHub Pages** – hosting  
- **Cloudflare** – DNS & domain management  

No backend required — everything runs client-side.

## 🚀 Deployment

The site is deployed automatically using **GitHub Pages**:

1. Code is pushed to the `main` branch  
2. GitHub builds and deploys the site  
3. The custom domain `owenlab.dev` points to the live version via Cloudflare  

No manual server management is required.

## 🎯 Purpose

Owen Lab exists as:

- A public portfolio  
- A place to document experiments  
- A showcase for Minecraft mods and tools  
- A launch page for future projects  
- A personal learning log  

Content will grow and evolve over time as new projects are added.
